#,AdultEducationSubsidies,성인 교육 보조금,성인 교육 보조금은 근로자가 취업한 후에도 재교육과 학습을 지속할 수 있도록 유도하는 방안이다. 보조금의 지급대상으로는 야간 수업 수강생이나 원격학습 자료 이용자 등이 포함된다. 이러한 제도는 노동자의 전반적인 교육 수준을 높이는 데 도움이 된다.
#,AgricultureSubsidies,농업 보조금,"안보전략적 이유로 몇몇 정부들은 국가의 안정적인 식량 공급을 보장하기 위해 농민들에게 기꺼이 보조금을 지급한다. 이는 자유시장원리에 어긋나고 상당한 비용이 들어갈 수 있지만 동시에 농부들의 일자리와 표를 지키는 데에도 도움이 된다."
#,AirlineTax,항공유 과세,항공유는 일반적으로 과세 대상이 아니다. 항공유 과세 지지자들은 이러한 조세특례를 환경에 파괴적인 교통수단의 이용을 장려하는 불공정한 특혜라 주장한다. 반면 항공사들은 항공유에 세금이 붙으면 국외에서 급유하는 항공사가 늘어나 국부 유출만 일어날 것이라 지적한다.
#,AlcoholLaw,주류법,"과도한 음주는 건강에 해를 끼치고 심지어는 사망으로도 이어질 수 있다는 증거는 충분하다. 하지만 개인이 무엇을 마시건 개인의 자유지 국가가 상관할 일이 아니라는 사람들도 있다. 또한 정부는 술에 세금을 매겨서 많은 돈을 벌 수 있기 때문에 문제는 더욱 복잡해진다."
#,AlcoholTax,주류세,"건강 악화와 각종 사회문제를 야기할 수 있는 알코올 섭취를 줄이기 위해 정부가 술에 세금을 부과해야 함을 지지하는 의학적 논거는 명확하다. 반면에 사회생활을 하면서 가볍게 음주를 하는 사람들은 정부가 주류세로 이익을 보는 것이 위선적 행태라고 본다."
#,ArmedPolice,무장경찰,경찰을 무장시키는 것은 범죄를 예방하고 질서를 유지하는데 효과적인 전략이 될 수 있다. 반대자들은 되려 범죄자들이 군비경쟁 하듯 경쟁적으로 무장하도록 부추길 것이라 주장한다. 또한 경찰을 무장시킬수록 선량한 시민들은 경찰과 거리감을 느낄 우려가 있다는 비판 역시 제기된다.
#,BanSundayShopping,일요일 상점영업 금지,기독교에서는 일반적으로 안식일을 휴일이라 보기 때문에 많은 교인들은 이 날에는 쇼핑을 해서는 안된다고 믿는다. 또한 일부 노동조합들은 강제휴업이 노동착취를 막아줄 수 있다고 믿는다.
#,BiofuelSubsidies,바이오연료 보조금,"Biofuels can reduce oil demand, by mixing ethanol derived from corn with petro-chemical fuel. This is generally popular with environmentalists. Farmers who earn money producing corn for biofuel use also benefit. Biofuels with a higher mix of ethanol can be subsidized through tax breaks."
#,BorderControls,출입국관리,"국경에 세관 검사와 같은 절차를 두지 않는다면 불법이민에 나라의 문이 활짝 열리는 큰 문제가 발생할 것이다. 일각에서는 이민자들이 국내에서 범죄를 일으키거나, 일자리를 뺏어간다고 주장한다. 출입국관리는 불법이민을 줄이는 효과적인 방안이 될 수 있다."
#,BusLanes,버스전용차선,"Setting aside specific lanes of a road for use only by buses (and perhaps taxis and motorbikes) is one way to get traffic flowing faster and avoid congestion. It also shortens journey times for public transport and therefore encourages usage. There are noticeable costs involved in setting up such schemes, and motorists can be annoyed if the bus lanes seem empty while they remain stuck in traffic."
#,BusSubsidies,버스 보조금,"Traffic congestion and pollution can be reduced by encouraging people to travel by bus instead of car. It can be an expensive option though, and some motorists may resent a transport system they do not use being subsidized."
#,CarbonTax,탄소세,"A carbon tax is a tax levied on all emissions of Carbon Dioxide, thought to be the main cause of climate change. The tax is effectively a pollution tax, and a way to make those individuals and industries who contribute to climate change pay for the damage they cause or to reduce emissions. Obviously the tax is popular with environmentalists, and can also lead to a more energy efficient economy."
#,CarEmmissionsLimits,자동차 배출가스 기준,"Setting legal limits on exhaust fumes helps to reduce air pollution, especially in cities, but it's unpopular with motorists who look upon it as yet more bureaucracy and tax."
#,CarTax,자동차세,"모든 자동차에 대해 소유자에게 세금을 부과하는 것은 사람들이 대체 교통수단을 이용하도록 유도하는 방안 중 하나이다. 그러나 자동차세는 자동차 소유의 고정비용을 증가시키기 때문에, 일단 자동차세를 납부한 다음에는 오히려 차를 더 많이 몰도록 유도한다는 주장도 제기된다. 또한 소득이 적은 빈곤층이나 자동차 이용이 사실상 필수적인 농촌지역 주민들에게 불공평한 부담을 준다는 주장도 있다."
#,CCTVCameras,CCTV 카메라,"CCTV 카메라는 범죄자를 잡는데 큰 도움이 될 수 있으며, 카메라 자체가 범죄를 억제하기도 한다. 하지만 CCTV는 설치비용이 높으며, 정부로부터 지속적으로 감시받는 느낌을 받기 싫어하는 사람들은 기본권 침해 우려가 있다고 주장한다."
#,ChildBenefit,아동수당,"A fixed payment made by the state directly to parents to assist in the cost of bringing up children. Popular with parents for obvious reasons, and the poor who see it as a redistributive tax, but capitalists are opposed to such an unnecessary level of interference by government."
#,ChildcareProvision,보육수당,"By giving state subsidies for childcare, we can ensure more parents return to the workforce after having children, and therefore benefit the economy. Although this can be expensive, and is also a distortion of the market, it is popular with parents."
#,CitizenshipTests,시민권 시험,"Citizenship tests are a way of ensuring that people migrating to our country have a demonstrable understanding of our culture and history. This lessens the chances of a clash of cultures for newcomers to the country, encourages integration and reassures patriotic members of society that they need not fear immigration."
#,CleanEnergySubsidies,친환경에너지 보조금,"Renewable energy might not be ultra efficient yet, but there is an argument for investing heavily in it now so as to strategically prepare our country for a future without fossil fuels. Environmentalists are happy for obvious reasons, but capitalists see it as an unwelcome distortion of the energy market."
#,CleanFuelSubsidy,친환경연료 보조금,"A Subsidy for cleaner fuels such as Ultra-Low Sulfur fuel in an effort to reduce the environmental impact of motoring. The subsidy will reduce the costs of fitting catalytic converters to older cars, and provide an incentive at the  pump to choose less damaging fuels."
#,CommunityPolicing,지역경찰제,"지역경찰제는 지역사회의 치안상태를 통제하려 하는 대신 지역사회와 협력하는 관계를 만들어나가는 경찰활동을 추구한다. 이를 위해 경찰에게 지역사회의 필요를 더 잘 이해하는 방향을 권장하며, 이는 특히 소수민족이 다수 거주하는 지역에서 더 강조된다. 그러나 비판측에서는 이를 범죄를 줄이는데 직접 사용해야 할 예산을 쓸데없이 마구 낭비하는 정책이라 말한다."
#,ConsumerRights,소비자 권리,"At a minimum level, the state guarantees that the consumer is not totally ripped off, at the other end of the spectrum, draconian legislation can benefit the consumer at the expense of business. Companies often complain about the amount of legislation governing selling to the public."
#,CorporationTax,법인세,"사업에서 발생한 수익에 부과하는 직접세이자 비례세이다. 일각에는 세금을 법인세만 걷어야 한다는 주장도 있지만, 다른 한편으로는 법인세가 기업가 정신을 억누르고 새로운 사업을 해보려는 의욕을 꺾는다는 주장도 나온다. 법인세는 정부가 세입을 확보하는 주된 방법 중 하나로 자주 사용된다."
#,Creationism,교육의 세속화,"아이들을 가르치는 방식이 과학과 종교중에서 어느 쪽이어야 하는지에 관한 격렬한 논쟁은 지금까지도 이어지고 있다. 과학계와 진보진영은 각종 증거가 뒷받침하는 진화론을 과학수업에서 가르쳐야 함이 당연하다고 본다. 하지만 일부 종교단체는 진화론이나 다윈주의가 아직 증명되지 않았다거나 창조론도 과학의 대안적인 이론으로 가르쳐야 한다는 이유를 대면서 진화론을 사실로써 가르치는 것은 부당하다고 말한다. 학교에서 어느 쪽을 가르쳐야 할지는 정부가 결정해야 할 일이다."
#,Curfews,야간통행금지,"Introduced  for a short period of time in  state of national emergency. These can be an effective way to combat crime at the cost of much personal liberty. Often, however, limiting the ability of peaceful citizens to leave their homes at night can be a sign of a country's degeneration into severe authoritarianism."
#,DeathPenalty,사형제,"The death penalty is the ultimate punishment for serious crimes. Opponents are concerned by the possibility of killing the wrong person, and suggest that only a barbaric state has the death penalty. Supporters point out that it absolutely guarantees no re-offending, and acts as a deterrent to serious crime."
#,DetentionWithoutTrial,재판 없는 구금,"Detention without trial allows your police and security services to detain suspects when they do not have sufficient evidence (or cannot reveal sensitive evidence) to convict suspects. This can be justified in the name of preventing terrorism, but Liberals are concerned that this infringes human-rights."
#,DisabilityBenefit,장애급여,"A direct payment from the state to disabled people to allow for the fact that they are possibly unable, or need assistance to work. Additionally many disabled people have special requirements in terms of transport or housing."
#,FaithSchoolSubsidies,종교학교 보조금,Religious schools can achieve good academic standards. Their supporters make a case  that the government should subsidize methods of education that are proven to be effective. Critics say that religion has no place in education and that the government cannot be seen to 'push' a particular religion on children.
#,ForeignAid,대외원조,"몇몇 해외국가들은 경제사정이 매우 어렵고, 빈약한 교육과 식량부족 사태 등을 겪고 있는데, 여기서 상대적으로 부유한 국가들이 어려운 국가를 돕는 것은 도덕적 의무라는 주장이 나온다. 하지만 반대로 국가의 최우선 책무는 자기 국민을 챙기는 것이고, 만약 어려운 나라를 도와주고 싶은 국민이 있다면 개인적으로 자선단체를 통해 도와주면 된다는 반론도 제기된다."
#,FreeBusPasses,노년층 무임승차제,"Traditionally, free bus travel is offered as a concession to those citizens of retirement age. This can be expensive, but it's a great way to reduce car usage and thus reduce pollution and congestion. Some oppose such a distortion of the market however."
#,FreeEyeTests,무료 시력검사,"Eye tests catch problems early and advise those with poor eyesight that they need glasses. Getting your eyes tested privately can be expensive, and it's a luxury many people just do without. Socialists believe that the universal provision of free eye tests are essential in providing a health 'safety net' for all."
#,FreeSchoolMeals,무상급식,"Not only are free school meals a way of redistributing wealth by ensuring everyone can afford to feed their children, its also a way to ensure that children eat healthily rather than surviving purely on junk food."
#,Gambling,도박 합법화,"To some, gambling is a sin which leads to poverty and disaster, but others believe that some 'social' gambling is harmless fun which can also be taxed nicely by the government as an additional form of revenue. It also encourages tourism and creates jobs."
#,GatedCommunities,출입통제형 주거단지,"길거리 범죄와 공공기물파손에 대한 다소 극단적인 해법이라 할 수 있는 출입통제형 주거단지는 자체적으로 치안을 유지하는 주거단지로, 담벼락으로 외부인의 출입을 제한한다. 이러한 주거단지는 부유층에게 인기가 높지만, 부유층이 아니고서는 입주하기가 불가능하기 때문에 계층분화와 불평등에 관한 비판이 따라나온다. 이에 몇몇 정부는 출입통제형 주거단지 건축허가를 꺼리고는 한다."
#,GraduateTax,졸업세,"A graduate tax is a dedicated tax levied purely on people graduating from university, as a way of them contributing to the cost of their university tuition. Supporters say this is fair because not everyone benefits from a university education. Opponents argue that it creates a disincentive to study purely academic subjects and the arts, as well as penalizing ambition."
#,HandgunLaws,총기관리법,"Some countries allow the virtually unrestricted ownership of any kind of firearm, whereas in others it is strictly controlled. Some people talk of the basic right to defend yourself, others are concerned that gun ownership leads to gun crime."
#,HybridCarsInitiative,하이브리드차 지원계획,"Hybrid cars are less damaging to the environment, because at slower speeds they use electric engines that produce no CO2. They also get higher fuel efficiency, thus reducing demand for oil. The downside is they are very expensive, but tax incentives can encourage more people to buy hybrid models when they get new cars."
#,IDCards,신분증,"Some say ID Cards act as a powerful deterrent against terrorism and other serious crimes, but liberals would argue that it is an infringement of an individual's civil liberties for the state to demand that citizens identify themselves on the spot."
#,ImportTarrifs,관세,"Cheap imports can be damaging to the economy because local companies cannot match the lower salaries paid by foreign competitors. Import tariffs help to protect local manufacturers from 'unfair' competition. This does go against real free-market economics though, and can be seen as being unfair to foreign countries, possibly sparking retaliation."
#,IncomeTax,소득세,"정부가 세수확보에 가장 흔하게 사용하는 방법 중 하나는 사람들의 소득에 직접세를 메기고 고용주 선에서 원천징수를 하는 것이다. 소득세는 일반적으로 소득이 많을수록 한계세율이 올라가는 누진세의 형태를 띠며, 이는 사회주의자와 저소득층이 이러한 조세제도를 선호하는 이유로 작용한다."
#,FlatTax,평률소득세,"평률소득세는 전체소득과 무관하게 모든 시민이 동일한 한계세율의 소득세를 납부하는 조세제도이다. 따라서 CEO와 사무실 청소부는 비록 내는 금액은 CEO가 더 많겠지만 동일한 세율을 적용받게 된다. 이렇게 간단한 과세구조는 절세와 탈세를 줄이는 데에 도움이 된다. 하지만 누진성이 없는 조세제도이며 따라서 소득불평등을 악화시킬 가능성이 있다."
#,CapitalGainsTax,양도소득세,"양도세는 근로소득에 과세하는 근로소득세와 달리 주식, 부동산, 기타 자산 등의 양도차익에 부과하는 세금이다. 양도세는 주로 부유층과 사업주들에게 영향을 끼치며, 경제가 호황일수록 조세수입이 늘어난다. 또한 투자수익에 과세를 하게 되므로 투자의욕을 약간 떨어뜨리고 경제에 악영향이 갈 수 있다."
#,InheritanceTax,상속세,"개인 재산이 상속으로 직계비속에게 이전되는 경우에 상속재산에 부과하는 세금이다. 상속세는 특정 가문이 세대를 걸쳐 부와 권세를 모으는 것을 방지하기 때문에, 평등을 중요시하는 사회주의자와 빈곤층에게 지지를 받는다. 하지만 열심히 일해서 벌은 재산과 특히 집을 자녀들에게 물려주는 것을 막는 세금에 강하게 반대하는 이들도 존재한다."
#,IntelligenceServices,정보기관,"안보기관은 조직범죄 및 테러에 맞서싸우는 데에 필수적인 도구이다. 유용하고 신뢰성이 높은 정보의 획득은 매우 어렵고 많은 비용이 들어갈 수 있으며, 따라서 정보기관이 이용하는 수단 상당수는 진보주의자와 인권단체에게 나쁜 평가를 받을 수 있다."
#,InternetCensorship,인터넷 검열,"Liberals would suggest that the internet's greatest characteristic is its freedom from censorship and control, leading to an open and tolerant society. Freedom has its price however, and there is no shortage of material on the internet that can assist those with criminal intent. Opinion on what should and should not be censored on the web is bitterly divided."
#,InternetTax,인터넷세,"As more and more commerce moves from conventional 'bricks and mortar' establishments to the web, governments are tempted to levy taxes on such transactions in order to 'level the playing field'. However, opponents of an internet tax claim that such a move would cripple the hi-tech economy and do enormous harm to the country's competitiveness."
#,JuryTrial,배심제도,"The right to be tried by ordinary members of the public rather than a judge is seen as a fundamental human right by many liberals. Conservatives argue that such a process is expensive, time wasting and is no fairer than a judge or a group of magistrates. Its entirely possible to have a system where a jury trial is reserved for more serious offences, with minor trials presided over by a magistrate."
#,LabourLaws,노조법,"노조법은 기본적으로 노동자의 파업권의 제한에 관해 다루는 법률이다. 자본주의자들은 파업 제한이 발전소 직원, 경찰, 기관사 등의 필수공익사업장 인력들이 국민을 볼모로 잡는 행위를 방지하려면 불가피하다고 주장한다. 노동조합원들은 노동자의 기본적 권리인 파업권은 절대 타협의 대상이 아니라고 생각한다."
#,LegalAid,법률구조제도,"Not everyone has the money to pay a lawyer to defend themselves in court. Although a citizen could theoretically defend himself, providing state-employed lawyers should make for a fairer system. On the other hand, this is basically a big subsidy to people who have already been charged with a crime but remember they are innocent until proved guilty."
#,LegaliseProstitution,성매매 합법화,"Conservatives claim that the legalization of prostitution would mark a severe decline in family values. Others claim that as prostitution is unlikely to disappear, even if illegal, it's better for society and sex-workers that the practice is regulated and monitored rather than criminalized."
#,LuxuryGoodsTax,사치세,"A tax aimed specifically at the high spenders in our society. A surcharge is added to high value luxuries such as sports cars, private yachts etc. Although it is never a vast source of income, a luxury goods tax can be popular with those people concerned with the gap between rich and poor. A luxury goods tax could encourage high earners to live and work elsewhere."
#,MarriedTaxAllowance,기혼자 세액공제,"This is a tax break for married couples, given as an encouragement for people to marry and also to stick together. Church groups see it as essential that the state encourages traditional family values. Some see it as religion meddling in the tax system for no good reason."
#,MaternityLeave,출산휴가,"To some people, ensuring that mothers have a right to maternity leave and to return to their jobs afterwards is a sign of a civilized society, and one that encourages women to work. Some small businesses are concerned that it can put an unpredictable and even potentially crippling burden on an employer, especially where the number of employees is small. It could be argued that this actually encourages employers not to employ women."
#,MicrogenerationGrants,자가전력 지원금,"These grants are given to citizens to help subsidize the cost of energy micro-generation systems such as solar panels and wind turbines. This is a good way to take advantage of some people's desire to make a personal step towards cleaner and greener energy, and will increase the country's overall energy efficiency."
#,MilitarySpending,국방비,"군의 현대화와 전력증강에는 막대한 재원이 소모될 수 있으며, 많은 사람들이 정부 예산에는 국방비 말고도 충분히 쓸 곳이 많다고 생각하기도 한다. 하지만 애국자를 비롯한 사회 일각에서는 자유와 안전에 가격을 매길 수는 없다고 주장하며, 국방비 지출이 국내 기업과 기술개발, 고용창출에 충분히 기여하고 있다고 지적한다."
#,Monorail,고속철도 보조금,"This is not a standard rail network that drags along at mediocre speeds, but a modern high-tech rail system fit for the twenty first century, connecting the country and allowing super-fast travel between major cities. The costs are high, but the benefits for commuters, the economy and the environment are clear."
#,MortgageTaxRelief,주택담보대출 소득공제,"주택담보대출 소득공제는 집을 사려고 담보대출을 받은 사람들이 담보대출 이자만큼 소득공제를 신청할 수 있게 해준다. 이러한 세제혜택은 주택 구입자들이 주택담보대출을 갚기 쉽게 해주지만, 사실상 주택 구입자들에게만 주어지는 세제혜택이기 때문에 집을 살 수 없는 사람들에게는 반발을 불러일으킬 수 있다."
#,Narcotics,마약류관리법,"대마나 헤로인과 같은 약물이 합법화되어야 하는가는 어려운 질문이다. 합법화 찬성측은 정말 문제가 되는건 마약밀매 과정에서 발생하는 범죄이며, 마약 합법화는 범죄를 줄일 것이라 주장한다. 반대측에서는 건강상의 위험을 지적하고, 합법화가 사실상 범죄자들에게 굴복하는 것이나 다름이 없다 말한다."
#,NationalService,징병제,"일부 시민들에게 국가를 침략으로부터 지켜내려면 어떻게 해야하는지 기초를 가르치는 의무 군복무 제도에는 여러 이점이 존재한다. 예를 들면 평시 정규군의 규모를 작게 유지할 수 있는 점이 있다. 하지만 본인 의사에 반하여 무기를 들도록 강제하는 것에 관한 우려도 존재한다."
#,OrganDonation,장기 기증,"There are few who would disagree that organ transplant is an amazing technology but it requires a plentiful supply of donors. Sadly many people do not give the topic consideration. Some suggest that an 'opt-out' policy is best, with consent for donation assumed unless otherwise stated. Others suggest that this is no place for the state to interfere and explicit permission should be requested."
#,OrganicSubsidy,유기농업 보조금,"Supporters of organic farming say the state should subsidize this method of farming because of the perceived health benefits of food without artificial flavorings and additives. Naturally this is popular with farmers and environmentalists, but some people see it as a pointless distortion of what should be a free market."
#,PetrolTax,유류세,"석유파생연료에 유류세를 부과하면 정부는 큰 조세수입원을 얻을 수 있고, 사람들이 운전을 덜 하거나 더 효율적인 자동차를 이용하도록 유도하는 친환경 정책으로 이용할 수도 있다. 하지만 비판측에서는 정부가 또다시 운전자들에게 나쁜 세금을 거두는 것에 불과하다고 주장하며, 일각에서는 대중교통과 같은 대안이 누구나 이용가능한 선택지는 아니라는 불만도 나온다."
#,PhoneTapping,감청,"From a law and order perspective, wire tapping is an essential weapon in the fight against organized crime and terrorism. The problem is that it's difficult to prevent misuse of such a system, and liberals are keen to point out how widespread wire tapping is a very sinister sign of a police state."
#,PlasticBagTax,비닐봉투세,"Plastic bags, unlike paper ones are not biodegradable so can last more or less forever, eventually ending up in huge unsightly landfill sites. A tax on bags discourages their use and encourages people to re-use stronger, more environmentally friendly alternatives. Capitalists just see this as the state meddling."
#,PoliceForce,경찰,"정부가 질서를 수호하고 법이 지켜지도록 경찰을 둘 필요가 있음에는 이견이 없지만, 경찰에 어느정도의 예산이 들어가야 하는지는 논쟁의 대상이다. 길거리마다 경찰이 보일 정도로 큰 경찰을 선호하는 사람이 있는가 하면, 좀 이목도 덜 끌고 느슨한 접근법을 선호하는 사람도 있다."
#,PollutionControls,공해방지법,"Restrictions on what chemicals and emissions can be released into the atmosphere. Controls reduce pollution and increase health, possibly at the cost of economic competitiveness."
#,PrisonerTagging,전자발찌,"A high tech alternative to incarceration that allows people to re-integrate with the community upon release from prison, whilst allowing law enforcement authorities to keep a close eye on them. Liberals have concerns that such a system is a step towards a police state which monitors our every move."
#,Prisons,교도소,"교도소에 관해서는, 법을 어긴 사람들은 최소한으로만 지어둔 차갑고 텅 빈 감방에 눌러담아야 한다고 주장하는 이들이 있다. 반면에 교도소에 예산을 더 써야 재소자들을 처벌함과 동시에 교화시켜서 재범률을 낮출 수 있다고 주장하는 이들도 존재한다."
#,PropertyTax,재산세,"재산세는 주택의 가격에 따라 부과하는 세금이다. 주택의 가치평가는 정부기관에서 하는 경우가 많으며, 징수된 재산세는 일부 또는 전부 지방정부의 가로등 관리나 소방 및 구급등의 응급서비스 예산에 사용된다. 일각에서는 재산세를 대형주택 소유자나 부유층에게 주로 영향을 주는 공정한 세금이라 말하지만, 다른 한편에서는 대형주택을 보유하고 있으나 실제 소득은 별로 없는 은퇴자들에게 부담을 주는 불공정한 세금이라 말한다."
#,PublicLibraries,공공도서관,"Public libraries provide a number of services, acting as a focus for communities, providing access to information and literature to those on low incomes, and enabling people to learn new skills outside the normal educational establishment."
#,RacialProfiling,인종기반 수사기법,"Racial (or ethnic) profiling is the practice of using race as a factor in identifying criminals and potential criminals. Law enforcement officials claim that using racial profiling allows them to quickly narrow down lists of potential suspects, and to best concentrate their efforts but opponents fear that it leads to racial discrimination by the police."
#,RaceDiscriminationAct,인종차별금지법,"Prevents citizens being discriminated against purely on the basis of race, i.e. racist employment practices etc."
#,Recycling,재활용,"Supporters of recycling argue that dumping waste in landfills just isn't a long term solution, and the government needs to show the way by providing facilities to recycle as many waste materials as possible. This might include recycling newspapers, cardboard, bottles and even some plastics."
#,RoadBuilding,도로건설,"환경주의자들은 도로를 더 만들어도 교통체증만 더 늘어난다고 주장하지만, 교통정체에 발이 묶인 운전자들은 당연히 그렇게 생각하지 않을 것이다. 새 도로의 건설에는 매우 많은 비용과 시간이 들어가지만, 경제가 제대로 굴러가게 하려면 꼭 필요한 투자라는 주장도 존재한다."
#,RuralDevelopmentGrants,농촌개발지원금,"As technology advances and more and more citizens take jobs in our cities, there is a danger that poverty and unemployment will rise to unacceptable levels in the countryside. Rural development grants do distort the free market, but they also support rural businesses and prevent poverty amongst farmers and other rural occupations."
#,SalesTax,부가가치세,"부가가치세는 전형적인 역진세로, 개인의 담세력을 고려하지 않는 세금이다. 비판측에서는 부가가치세가 빈곤층에게 불균형한 부담을 주며 불평등의 심화로 이어진다고 주장한다. 지지측에서는 상대적으로 징수가 용이하고 모든 사람들이 세금을 부담하는 공정한 조세제도라고 주장한다. 기업들은 부가가치세로 인한 행정작업 부담으로 인해 반대를 표하고는 한다."
#,SateliteRoadPricing,위성위치측정식 통행요금체계,An expensive system that requires transponders to be fitted to everyone's car and keeps track of what roads people use (and when). Allows per-road pricing for car usage which gives local authorities fine control over reducing congestion without burdening motorists in more remote rural areas who have no alternative transport system.
#,SchoolBuses,통학버스 보조금,"State subsidies for school buses ensure that every school kid has an efficient, and safe journey to school, whilst reducing the number of short 'school-run' trips carried out by parents, thus reducing traffic on the roads. Parents are also happier knowing that there are proper approved school buses."
#,SchoolPrayers,교내 예배,"Liberals will often argue that the education of our younger citizens should be kept entirely separate from any religious teachings. On the other hand, it's argued that some compulsory prayer in schools is a way of promoting moral values in our children."
#,ScienceFunding,과학기금,"대부분의 연구가 민간기업의 지원을 받아 이루어지는 국가도 있지만, 초장기 연구 프로젝트나 상업성이 떨어지는 프로젝트에는 국가지원이 도움이 될수 있다. 국가부분의 연구활동에서 얻은 성과는 특정 기업의 특허로 묶이지 않고 대중에 자유로이 공개된다."
#,SmallBusinessGrants,중소기업 지원금,"The failure rate for small businesses is very high. In the early years of trading, a preferential government grant can be an enormous help to get a new enterprise off the ground. This can lead to a big boost to the economy, but it can also be an expensive policy with no guarantee of good results."
#,SpaceProgram,우주 개발 프로그램,"Invest in your country's efforts to explore space! As well as the purely scientific benefits, a well-funded space program will boost the level of technological expertise throughout the entire economy. It will also unite the country and encourage patriotism."
#,SpeedCameras,과속카메라,"Speed cameras are an automated way to enforce speed restrictions on our roads, without having to invest a fortune in extra traffic police. Supporters claim they reduce road deaths and free up the police to deal with more serious crime, opponents claim they are a cynical way of taxing the motorist and have nothing to do with safety"
#,StateHealthService,공공의료보험,"많은 시민들이 보건의료에 개인적으로 비용을 지출하고는 하지만, 국가가 소득에 상관없이 모든 국민에게 최소수준의 보건의료는 무료로 제공해야 한다는 주장도 존재한다. 하지만 의료서비스 제공에는 많은 비용이 소모될 수 있기 때문에 얼마나 많은 예산을 투자해야 하는지는 항상 논쟁의 대상이다."
#,StateHousing,공공주택,"자기 집을 소유하는 편을 선호하는 사람들도 있지만, 주거비용은 너무나도 높아서 국민 대다수는 주택을 임대해 살아야 한다. 공공주택은 시중 임대료를 감당하지 못하는 이들을 대상으로 낮은 임대료에 주거지를 제공한다. 공공주택에는 많은 재원이 소모될 수 있지만, 사회적 편익도 상당하다."
#,StatePensions,공적연금,"은퇴 후 삶을 개개인이 알아서 책임지게 하는 대신 공적연금을 통해 노년층의 최저생계를 보장해줄 수 있다. 다만 기대수명이 점차 늘어남에 따라 연금 지급총액이 크게 증가함은 유의할 필요가 있다. 공적연금의 지급수준이 높아질수록 사적연금을 납입하는 사람은 줄어들 것이다."
#,StateSchools,공립학교,"모든 국민에게 무상교육을 제공하면 문해율을 높이고 기술인력을 공급해 경제에도 도움이 될 수 있다. 하지만 다른 한편에서 보면 공교육 정부지출은 상당히 많은 예산을 소모할 수 있다. 또한 자본주의자들은 공교육을 자유시장에 대한 불필요한 개입으로 여긴다."
#,StemCells,줄기세포 연구,"A stem cell is a primitive type of cell that can be developed into most of the types of cells found in the human body. Some scientists claim that stem cell research offers great hope for curing diseases such as diabetes and multiple sclerosis. However, because stem cells are taken from discarded human embryos, many 'pro-life' and religious groups oppose their usage."
#,TaxShelters,조세 피난처,"By not fully taxing the wealth of the super-rich, tax shelters can be a great way to encourage successful entrepreneurs to make our country their home. With an ever-shrinking world, the rich are free to settle wherever they please. encouraging them to live here may mean that they spend their wealth in this country. Such measures can be very unpopular with the poor, who resent paying tax on their much lower earnings."
#,TechnologyColleges,기술대학,"Technology colleges are 'specialist schools' with a focus on computer literacy, biotechnology and similar subjects. These state-run colleges receive special funding from central government in order to encourage a greater level of technological literacy amongst the future workforce."
#,TechnologyGrants,기술개발 지원금,"The government can provide state funding to encourage business to invest in new and exciting technologies. Although this helps give us a competitive advantage and can create jobs, it can be argued that its an unnecessary distortion of the market."
#,TelecommutingInitiative,재택근무 추진계획,"Telecommuting, or 'working from home' is seen as desirable because it reduces the pressure on the transport infrastructure, and can be an improvement to people's quality of life. It's also welcomed by parents. This policy offers tax incentives to companies supporting this option."
#,TobaccoTax,담배세,"담배회사들은 극구 부인하지만 흡연이 건강에 악영향을 준다고 볼만한 이유는 충분하다. 이러한 점은 담배에 세금을 부과하는 명분으로 이용된다. 이를 두고 정부 스스로가 반대하는 상품에 세금을 붙여 큰 이득을 얻는다며 비아냥을 듣기도 한다. 하지만 건강캠페인 진영에서는 담배세를 국민건강을 증진시킬 수 있는 수단으로 본다."
#,TollRoads,도로통행료,"Toll roads charge motorists to use specific roads (normally major highways). This is a great example of directly applying market forces, by only charging those who use a particular route for the construction and maintenance of that route. Motorists tend to see this as just another form of taxation, whereas commuters appreciate not being charged for roads they seldom use."
#,UnemployedBenefit,실업급여,Unemployment benefit is a state benefit given to everyone who is able to work but cannot find employment. Socialists regard this as a minimum safety net for workers out of work because of the whims of the economy. Some believe that high unemployment benefits distort the market and discourage people from seeking work.
#,UniversityGrants,대학 지원금,"Although not all citizens will pursue a university education, governments can provide subsidies to students to encourage a more educated workforce. University grants also ensure equality of opportunity, as in their absence the cost of a university education can be beyond the reach of working class families."
#,WelfareFraudDept,복지 부정수급 조사부,"When government gives so much money out in welfare payments, it's essential that the money is correctly targeted and not exploited by people making spurious claims. A dedicated fraud department will detect false claimants, recover lost money and reassure middle income tax payers that their taxes are being spent wisely, although it can antagonize legitimate claimants."
#,WinterFuelSubsidy,난방비 보조금,A special concession given to the elderly. This is a regular welfare payment made to everyone over retirement age towards the cost of their winter fuel bills. It is designed to reduce 'fuel poverty' which can occur when some elderly members of society cannot afford to heat their homes in winter.
#,WorkSafetyLaw,산업안전법,"Work safety law, often known as 'health and safety' is a series of measures to ensure employees are not at risk from injury in their day-to-day activities. Trade unionists often hail such laws as a valuable defense against unscrupulous employers who may put lives at risk. Many business leaders are concerned at the high levels of bureaucracy and restrictive practices that can result from such laws, which they see as a burden on business."
#,YouthClubSubsidies,청소년센터 보조금,"Free youth clubs ensure that teenagers have a 'place to go' which can help them to stay out of trouble, and in the long run, reduce the incidence of street crime. It can be resented by some wealthier taxpayers, who see it as an unnecessary expense, paid for by their taxes."
#,AbortionLaw,낙태법,"낙태만큼이나 논쟁이 격렬해지는 정책 분야는 많지 않다. 생명권 진영에서는 아직 출생하지 않은 태아에도 생명권이 있다는 주장을 펼치며, 흔히 종교적인 관점에서의 주장을 내놓기도 한다. 자기결정권 진영에서는 여성이 자기 신체를 가지고 무엇을 하건 국가가 이래라 저래라 할 일이 아니라는 주장을 편다. 낙태에 관한 국가의 입장을 바꾸려면 막대한 양의 정치력이 필요할 것이다."
#,RentControls,임대료 규제,"An alternative to state-housing is a system where the state will regulate the private-rental market in a bid to ensure the supply of affordable housing for all, even within the private sector. Capitalists will naturally see this as a distortion of the free market that will prevent enough homes being built, whereas supporters will say it prevents exploitation of the poor by greedy landlords."
#,SchoolVouchers,교육 바우처,"A measure designed to encourage the growth of private schooling, whilst still enabling everyone to afford an education. School  vouchers are issued by the state to parents for each child which they can then spend in the private sector on education. This is a different approach to pure state schooling because with school vouchers the schools are privately run and the teachers are no longer state employees."
#,OilDrillingSubsidy,석유 시추 보조금,"To encourage investment in new oil and gas drilling, and thus raise the supply of fossil fuel energy for the country, these tax breaks effectively subsidize fossil fuels. This will indirectly reduce fuel prices and stimulate the economy, but will be an outrage to environmentalists."
#,MansionTax,고급주택 보유세,"A special high rate of tax charged annually on the ownership of super-expensive homes. This tax is popular with some because it is almost impossible to avoid, as homes cannot be easily hidden. It is perceived as unfair by some elderly people who may have expensive homes but relatively low incomes, and thus have difficulty in paying the annual tax. It is a form of wealth-tax, as opposed to income tax."
#,FuelEfficiency,자동차 연비 규제,"Mandatory standards for new cars which dictate the minimum level of fuel efficiency. This is a long term measure aimed to raise the fuel efficiency of the country's cars, and thus reduce our dependence on oil, as well as reducing the cost of driving over the long term. It will be unpopular with car manufacturers, but a hit with environmentalists."
#,ForeignInvestorTaxBreaks,외국인투자 조세감면,"Special tax breaks given to large foreign-owned multinational companies to encourage them to invest in our country. This could include tax-free periods, introductory rates of corporate tax, and straight subsidies to encourage investment. Helps to encourage investment from overseas, but will be seen as incredibly unpatriotic, and pandering to the whims of huge foreign capitalist organizations."
#,RoboticsResearch,로봇 연구지원금,"A special grant to encourage research in robotics. Robotics is a very long term area of research which will eventually bring about vast boosts in productivity, but at the same time it will reduce the amount of low or semi-skilled jobs in the economy, and thus potentially lead to higher unemployment."
#,PrivatePrisons,민영 교도소,"Rather than directly control and manage a State prison service, this policy allows prisons to be privately owned and managed, and merely paid for by the state. Private prisons could result in lower cost and higher efficiency. These measures will be unpopular with trade unionists. Liberals will have ethical concerns about profiting from incarceration, but still be pleased if spending is high enough to promote rehabilitation."
#,JunkFoodTax,정크푸드세,"A punitive tax rate charged on unhealthy food such as takeaway hamburgers, fizzy drinks and high sugar or fat content pre-processed food. Levied with the aim of improving the health of the nation, but can be unpopular."
#,HealthFoodSubsidies,건강식품 보조금,"A tax incentive that makes healthy food, such as fruit and vegetables, cheaper than the higher fat or higher sugar foods. Seen as an incentive to eat well, rather than a punishment for eating badly, and thus less punitive on the poor than a 'fat tax'."
#,Tasers,테이저건,A non-lethal but still highly effective (and possibly dangerous) weapon which effectively gives criminals an electric shock. Supporters say it is a good compromise between the need to disable violent criminals and the risk of death associated with traditional firearms. Opponents claim that the use of such weapons lowers the barrier-to-use for the police and will encourage more casual use of force against the population.
#,PoliceDrones,경찰 드론,"Unmanned aerial reconnaissance vehicles, similar to remote control planes which can be employed by the police force. The 'eye in the sky' is a useful way to keep track of mobs and rioters, and allows for subtle yet effective surveillance. The police see it as a vital tool for modern crime fighting, but there are concerns that this is a step further towards a big-brother style surveillance society where everyone is tracked."
#,ArtsSubsidies,예술 보조금,"Investing public money in the arts is controversial with capitalists who see it as supporting uneconomic elitist entertainment, but others see it as vital to a countries culture, boosting our image on the world stage, and attracting tourists."
#,HealthcareVouchers,의료 바우처,"A measure designed to encourage the growth of private health care whilst still enabling everyone access to it. Healthcare vouchers are  issued by the state to everyone but can then only be spent in the private sector on health care. This is a different approach to pure state health care because with healthcare vouchers, the hospitals are privately run and the medical staff are no longer state employees."
#,HealthTaxCredits,의료비 세액공제,"A system of tax-reductions and credits designed to encourage people to spend their money on private healthcare, in order to reduce their tax liability. This boosts healthcare without involving the state running hospitals or employing doctors, but it's effect is limited to those people in society earning enough to be paying tax in the first place."
#,SchoolTaxCredits,교육비 세액공제,A system of tax-reductions and credits designed to encourage people to spend their money on private education in order to reduce their tax liability. This boosts private schooling without involving the State running schools or employing teachers but it's effect is limited to those people in society earning enough to be paying tax in the first place.
#,FoodStamps,푸드 스탬프,"Food stamps is a system where the state will issue vouchers or 'stamps' to those citizens on low or no income, to ensure they are able to afford food. Unlike giving a straight cash benefit, food stamps can only be redeemed for uncooked food, preventing them being used for unhealthy takeaway food. Supporters see food stamps as a valuable way to ensure nobody goes hungry, no matter their income. Critics consider such a scheme patronizing, and no more than papering over the cracks caused by free market failure and low wages."
#,FoodStandards,식품안전국,"A food standards agency is a branch of government dedicated to ensuring the safety and minimum nutritional standards of food supplied within the country. Farmers may regard the agency as an extra layer of bureaucracy and meddling, but public health campaigners see the agency as an essential line of defense between the consumer and unscrupulous food producers looking to cut costs."
#,EnterpriseInvestmentScheme,기업투자제도,"The Enterprise Investment Scheme is a system which gives tax breaks to wealthy individuals who invest their money in small startup companies which are based in this country. The scheme encourages investment in companies which should eventually grow and stimulate the economy, whilst at the same time giving a popular tax break to people who invest in them. Obviously indirectly, the scheme is being subsidized by those without savings to invest."
#,RecreationalDrugsTax,오락성 약물세,"In societies that have legalized drugs such as Cannabis and Psychedelics there is a temptation to treat consumption of these drugs as a source of government revenue, given the claims that their consumption should be politely discouraged due to the negative effects on citizens health, in a similar way to governments taxing alcohol or tobacco."
#,HumanCloningResearchGrants,인간복제 연구지원금,"Stem cell research was just the first step. Human cloning is around the corner and our country can be on the forefront of this groundbreaking development. The religious are enraged, but rich prospective parents hope to make the dream of replicating themselves true."
#,DroneStrikeAct,드론공습법,Global terrorism threatens our country. Drone strikes on foreign grounds are a safe way to prevent terror organisations from reaching their full potential. Patriots are calling for surgical strikes on terror leaders while liberals regard those as unethical.
#,ElectricCarsInitiative,전기차 지원계획,The introduction of a standardized nation-wide recharging system for electric cars has lead to increased sales of such vehicles. Encouraging the acquisition of electric cars reduces our countries dependence on oil. Environmentalists are happy about every car that does not emit carbon dioxide.
#,ClimateChangeAdaptionFund,기후변화적응기금,"Global warming has lead to increased frequency and severity of natural disasters. The Climate Change Adaption Fund finances large-scale projects from dams to weather satellites, from reforesting to water reservoirs. It might be expensive, but environmentalists and farmers call for this policy."
#,OneChildPolicy,한 자녀 정책,A one-child policy is a measure of population control to keep overpopulation and related economic and social problems at bay. It reduces poverty and stabilizes the fertility rate. Parents and religious people oppose the law.
#,MarsProgram,화성 프로그램,"Tabloids have been speaking of a new space age for a while. It is time to reach for the stars! Why not start with the neighbor planet Mars? The Mars Program yields new technological innovations, unites the country, and makes patriots proud."
#,AntibioticsBan,항생제사료 금지,"Ranchers and farmers have been feeding antibiotics to livestock since they discovered decades ago that small doses of antibiotics administered daily make most animals gain additional weight. Although conclusive evidence directly linking the use of drugs in food animals to an increase in drug-resistant bacteria has not been uncovered, a number of recent studies suggesting such a link concern many scientists. Banning antibiotics leads to decreased meat production but ensures consumer safety."
#,MandatoryMicrochipImplant,마이크로칩 의무이식,"Passports can be forged and fingerprints can be faked. A microchip under the skin makes every individual in this country technically recognizable. Once implemented, law enforcement will be able to track exactly who went where when. Liberals are enraged about the possibility of absolute surveillance."
#,RareEarthRefinement,희토류 채굴,Support national initiatives for rare earth metal mining in order to make the country's industrial and high tech production less dependent on imports from foreign countries. The extraction process is not good for the environment but our technological advancement depends on rare earth metals. Environmentalists are furious.
#,DriverlessCarLaws,자율주행법,Driverless car technology is booming. The manufacturers are encouraging the government to allow their use on public roads.
#,SyntheticMeatResearchGrants,인공배양육 연구지원금,"Overfarming, droughts and population growth result in increases in meat prices. Synthetic production can make meat affordable for the masses. Farmers are opposed, as food production moves from the field to the lab."
#,InternetCurrencyTaxation,암호화폐 과세,"More and more commerce is handled in cryptocurrencies. To cover the cost of tax evasion and tie the new currencies to the fiscal system, rules and taxation are required. An internet currency tax reduces the income of everyone trading in cryptocurrencies, mostly self-employed and small companies."
#,VerticalFarmSubsidies,수직농업 보조금,Farmland is getting rare but recent inventions in architecture and agriculture could easily be bundled to make vertical farming in cities feasible. Food production in vertical farms requires more resources but reduced transport costs mitigate that problem.
#,GreenElectronicsInitiative,친환경 전자제품 정책계획,"The goal of the Green Electronics Initiative is to reduce electronic waste. From cleaner mining operations to upcycling projects, a broad array of measures should make the digital world a cleaner place."
#,InternationalFusionResearchProject,국제 핵융합 연구 프로젝트,"Participate in an international nuclear fusion research and engineering project with the goal of creating a commercially viable fusion power plant.

Environmentalists are traditionally wary of atomic energy."
#,LimitAutomatedTrading,자동매매 제한,"Automated stock market trading software exploits minute movements and short-term patterns in the markets, yielding to higher volatility and instability. Stock market crashes can be prevented by limiting the abilities of automated trading. Capitalists and the wealthy profit most from automated trading."
#,AutomationTax,자동화세,"Technological innovation has led to brilliant inventions. The dark side of industrial automation is that it is leading to job loss. Less jobs mean less income tax. To make up for the loss in state income, the economy ministry has designed an automation tax, to be paid by the most advanced companies."
#,GovernmentSubsidiesForUnions,노동조합 정부보조금,"Trade unions provide a vital service to our nation, and it is in the collective interests of the people that they be encouraged and supported throughout all industries and workplaces. Therefore the government should provide funding, from taxation to support their activities."
#,SecretCourts,비공개 재판,"To combat modern terrorism and crime, it is sometimes necessary to keep things from the public. For that, secret courts are established and controlled by government officials to assure that the law is followed and not broken. We cannot effectively fight terrorism and serious crime if our secret services methods get exposed in open courts."
#,GeneralMediaCensorship,일반매체검열,"There are times when an outraged public is counterproductive to the well-being of a democracy. Enabling  general media censorship can prevent bad rumors and speculation from spiraling out of control and while it limits civil rights, less violence and fear might be worth the effort. We do not wish to give antisocial extremists the free use of our media to create unrest."
#,TortureUsageBySecretServices,정보기관의 고문 허용,"Terrorists are tough customers and to prevent some attacks, extraordinary measures sometimes have to be deployed. While it is never 100% clear how much crime and terrorism can be reduced by such a policy, surely it makes sense to not fight such enemies with one hand tied behind the back of our security services? You have to fight fire with fire."
#,CapCEOPayMultiplier,최고경영자 임금상한제,"Nobody disputes that the job of CEO of a large company is hard, but the current level of pay for executives is out of control and is causing huge anger among the lower paid. A cap on CEO pay is entirely reasonable in a just and fair society."
#,BanSecondHomeOwnership,다주택 보유 금지,"The laws of physics dictate that a person can only be in one place at once. So why would people have the need for two homes? With this policy, owning more than one house is outlawed and empty property will be seized by the government, greatly increasing social equality and giving more people a good home."
#,Banprivateeducation,사립학교 금지,"To make sure that school kids learn the right things and are not influenced by strange ideas, banning all private schools may be the  right thing to do. Now that no more so called elite schools exist, every kid has now the same chance to learn and become something great, boosting equality in the process, as children from all classes and income levels mix together."
#,Banprivatehealthcare,민간의료 금지,Why should some people enjoy better or experimental healthcare while others have to toughen it out? Banning private healthcare will make sure that no one gets special treatment while everyone gets what is needed for him or her to get well again. Nobody's health should be determined by the size of their bank balance.
#,Tradeunionbansatcompanies,노동조합 제한,"Companies face a lot of challenges in our modern times. Trade Unions often add to these challenges with their demands and needs, so banning these organizations will help the management focus on making the company competitive and maximize earnings. Of course the workers still have their rights, they just have to earn them without the backing of a wasteful institution."
#,Compulsoryworkfortheunemployed,실업자 의무근로,"Everyone receiving unemployment benefits now has to do some work every week or risk a payment cut in their benefits. This includes public beautification, collecting litter and other tasks that do not risk any jobs. The goal is to make use of this major workforce and get people back into a work routine, hopefully resulting in them getting jobs soon. Nobody should expect to live off the state without working."
#,Punitivewealthtax,징벌적 부유세,"There is nothing wrong with wealth as such, but inequality in our society is bad enough that we must be seen to do something to ensure those with the highest levels of income bear their share of the costs of maintaining a healthy society. It is entirely reasonable to set a tax rate that takes away the majority of income above extremely high levels, as this money is so much more appreciated by those on lower incomes."
#,Publictaxreturns,세금신고서 공개,"Unfortunately some wealthy people in our society try to avoid taxes with illegal tax evasion methods. By  making tax returns public, people can now check if someone is using loopholes or abusing the system. This full disclosure  will encourage support of the system, as well as reducing tax evasion and forcing everyone to be able to justify their income."
#,Compulsorylanguagelessons,외국어강좌 의무수강,"Some people just can't be bothered to learn languages on their own in order to improve their chances on the job market or to understand other people from different nations. Compulsory language lessons will force these people to deal with the world outside, improve our attitudes to foreign visitors, and enable us to better deal with foreign companies, all whilst giving us a greater understanding of other cultures."
#,Banforeignchurchservice,외래종교 예배금지,"Misunderstandings can lead to tragedies and nothing has caused more trouble and deaths in the past than religious conflict. The easiest way to prevent further trouble here is to ban foreign church service outright, avoiding further misunderstandings and unrest."
#,Diversityquotasforcompanies,기업 다양성할당제,"A diverse company is a happy and healthy company. Enabling diversity quotas for companies will force companies hire more people from different ethni backgrounds that have the same qualification, easing racial tensions and making companies a place of equal opportunity."
#,Newcarsubsidies,신차 보조금,"New cars are expensive but also cause less strain on the environment, while old and used cars may be cheaper but also cause more pollution. Using new car subsidies will help people buy new cars that are safer and protect the environment while making motorists happy. New car smell for everyone!"
#,Flagsoneverystreetcorner,국기 의무게양,"To boost patriotism and to induce a sense of belonging into people, putting flags of our country on every street corner will help with our national self esteem. It also looks much better than some burger advertisement."
#,Nationalanthematstartofnews,뉴스 시보 국가 방영,Flashy introductions for news shows may look fancy but it's missing the point: These news are for our people in our country. So we should make that clear and add a flair of patriotism and pride by having the national anthem played at the start of the news instead.
#,Nationalanthemsinschool,학교 국가제창,Young people these days have lost all sense of belonging. Starting the day in school with the national anthem will boost their national pride and help disciplining them. They may not always like it but it's good for them.
#,Compulsorychurchattendance,교회참석 의무화,How can you be saved if you don't listen to what is important and how to live your life? Making church attendance compulsory will save many souls and lead to a better life for the majority of our people. Too bad about those that do not believe in the right thing.
#,Forcepoliticalmilitaryreligiousoath,공무원 및 군인 종교선서 의무화,"Adding religion to oaths given in public by our officials and troops will create a greater sense of honor and security to the public, giving them the feeling that what we are doing is the right thing to do. With righteousness on our side, nothing can go wrong."
#,Publicreligiousbroadcasts,종교방송편성,The voice of faith and reason needs to be heard to have an effect. Adding public religious broadcasts will do a great service in countering all the bad influences of modern mass media as well as making people value the right things again.
#,Bandivorce,이혼 금지,The holy institution of marriage was not meant to be severed by anything other than death. Nowadays people divorce for the silliest things and this threatens whole families and the well being of our children even though often husband and wife just have to toughen through the hard part. Banning divorces will give marriage back it's true meaning.
#,Banhomosexuality,동성애 금지,"According to many religious texts, homosexuality is a sin. In order to combat this, banning homosexuality might convince many sinners to get their life back on track and follow the natural order that God intended."
#,Banlowmpgcars,저효율 자동차 금지,"With gas prices climbing constantly and nature being polluted from all sides, banning cars that use too much fuel may be the right step to protect the environment and help with excessive fuel usage. A big street cruiser might look cool, but it's way too expensive and wasteful and should be banned from the streets. What is good for the enviornment is good for society."
#,Mandatorymicrogeneration,자가발전 의무화,"One of the biggest cost factor in our lives these days is electricity and heat. By making micro generation mandatory, every citizen has the task of generating at least a part of his or her electricity by using solar or wind power, depending on their situation and where they live. A big step towards lowering CO2 Emissions."
#,Punitivetaxonsuperstores,대형마트 징벌과세,"Superstores may be convenient for out citizens, but they have many negative effects, they encourage car journeys, rather than supporting local shops, and their dominance is encouraging a society dominated by big business, with no room for the small family owned store. They should be taxed to reflect the harm they do to the fabric of our society."
#,Limitorbancarsincities,도심지 자동차 통행제한,"Cars are a major factor in air pollution, especially in big cities. Adding a congestion charge or outright banning them from cities will help greatly in fighting air pollution in cities and will increase the use of public transportation. It might look a little extreme to ban cars altogether but it's still better than to breathe in all that poison."
#,Closeairportscompletely,공항 폐쇄,"An extreme measure to fight pollution, closing down all airports will have severe effects on trade, foreign relations and tourism but will cause much less pollution and increase the usage of other transportation. In this modern day, we simply cannot turn a blind eye to the damage to the environment that is being done by our air travel industry. Desperate times call for desperate measures."
#,HealthyEatingCampaign,건강식습관 캠페인,"Through cooking shows, advertisements and specials in newspapers and other media, people are encouraged to be aware of what they eat, what the results of unhealthy food are and how to cook a good meal. This raises the overall health of the people while reducing obesity."

#,CarPoolingCampaign,카풀 캠페인,"It often takes some encouragement for people to come together and make better use of the resources at hand.

And if you still end up in a traffic jam, you at least have people to talk to while waiting."
#,KeepTheCountryTidyCampaign,꺠끗한 나라 만들기 캠페인,"A campaign in popular media, designed to make people feel guilty about littering. No matter how much a fine on littering may be, this only works if people are being seen. But a guilty conscience will also work when someone is alone, thus making it far more effective in the long run."
#,TourismAdCampaign,관광홍보 캠페인,"Tourism is not only a source of income for many people and businesses, it also strengthens foreign relations. This campaign will run in foreign countries, showing our most beautiful places, important sights to see, wonderful people to meet, tasty beers to drink and maybe even throws in a few free tickets to museums and shows, all in the hopes of attracting more people to visit us."
#,AlcoholAwarenessCampaign,알콜중독 예방 캠페인,"Alcohol can be dangerous, even in moderation. To raise awareness of that, this campaign will show all the trouble that alcohol can get you into, from ruined friendships over accidents and addiction to sickness and death. Certainly not a happy topic, but it is always better to have your mood dampened a little now and stay sober than to suffer big time later."
#,BusinessStartupCampaign,스타트업 캠페인,"Many people have brilliant ideas, yet only a few of them dare to take the steps necessary to set up their own little business around their idea. This campaign will help these people out, informs them what they need to do, where they need to go and what permits they need to get. This will help a great deal and make self employed people happy."
#,YouthPoliticsCouncil,청소년의회,"민주주의 국가라면 아이들에게 정치는 어떻게 굴러가고 정치를 통해 무엇을 이룰 수 있는지를 가르치는 것은 매우 중요하다. 청소년의회를 설치한다면 청소년들이 지역사회나 지자체 단계에서 직접적인 경험을 쌓으면서 실제로 정치를 통해 변화를 이루어내는 과정을 확인할 수 있으며, 어쩌면 미래의 지도자급 인재를 발굴할 수 있을지도 모른다."
#,NationalArmedForcesWeek,국군의 날 기념식,"Our heroes and protectors need to be recognized. By establishing a National Armed Forces Week, this can be done by celebrating their service for our country, making them feel appreciated and showing the public who these brave men and women are that would risk their lives for our safety."
#,FreeParentingClasses,무료 육아수업,"Having a newborn child can be very taxing and exhausting for new parents. By introducing these free classes, parents can learn how to deal with this situation, how to raise their babies and have a normal life at the same time. It won't make the babies cry less, but it will make the parents more stress resistant and aware, plus they will meet other parents in the same situation."
#,NationalBusinessCouncil,전국경제인협의회,"The establishment of a national business council gives a strong voice to business interests and ensures that the needs of business, both big and small are taken into account. The council serves as a way to promote capitalism and enterprise and get accross the message that the corporate world has much to offer, creates employment and prosperity."
#,SocialJusticeFoundation,사회정의재단,"This policy will establish a foundation that deals with the worries and problems of the poor and under-represented in our country. It will take away some of the worries these people have and gives them a better feeling of being included into society. It won't get them a better life directly, but at least some hope of a better future, and hope is very important to have."
#,SmartMeterProgram,스마트미터 프로그램,"By installing Smart Meters into their homes, people can save money and the environment at the same time, as it will increase the effeciency of energy used.

#,TradeCouncil,무역위원회,"It has always been a hassle to find trustworthy trading partners in foreign countries.

This will increase international trade and boost the economy."
#,CompulsoryForeignLanguageClasses,외국어 의무교육,"To understand their language is the first important step to understand other people.

This will reduce racial tension while improving foreign trade and relations."
#,LaborDayBankHoliday,노동절 공휴일 지정,"This makes Labor Day an official bank holiday, thus reminding citizens that it is not all about money in our life. While this will certainly help to increase the happiness of the working class and everyone who wants to have a good time, it will have a slight negative impact on the economy because a day wasted is money lost."
#,CityFarms,도시 농업,"Many people would love to buy fresh produce from farmers directly, but living in the city, this is often a hassle to drive out to the countryside. So why not bring some farmers to the cities directly? This program helps ambitious farmers to establish farms in or around cities so they can be close to their customers and it will get some of the city kids to consider a career in farming."
#,EcoHomeRegulations,주택 환경규제,"By setting rules and standards for houses towards eco-friendliness, there are many more things to be considered now when building houses. This may cause a hassle for developers and landlords, but it will help protect the environment in the long run."

#,DiplomaticService,외교통상본부,"Going beyond just having an ambassador and a secretary in a foreign country, employing a full Diplomatic Service may be more expensive, but in the field of international diplomacy, you need to stay on top of things in order to get the best deals for your country and to keep everyone involved and happy. It may take some time to get working effectively, but it will boost foreign relations."
#,WitnessProtectionProgram,증인보호 프로그램,"What good is catching a criminal if the witness to the crime disappears forever? Protecting these witnesses is of utmost importance for a working justice system, and the better it is, the more criminals get convicted and the more witnesses come forward if they see a crime."
#,CompulsorySchoolSports,스포츠수업 의무화,"By going beyond the physical education once in a week in schools, this program will introduce fully fledged sports classes. Pupils will be encouraged to pick a field they like and train for it, later competing in school tournaments on a local, regional and even national and international level, if they are good enough. This will increase the health of our children."
#,BicycleSubsidies,자전거 보조금,"To encourage people to switch from car to bike, a financial motivation is sometimes needed. By introducing bicycle subsidies, it will now be easier and cheaper for people to buy bikes. And this will result in more people actually using a bike instead of driving a car or staying inside, boosting the health of all citizens by a little."
#,FrequentFlyerTax,항공기 상용고객세,This Tax is charged only for passengers taking multiple flights per year. The idea behind it is to both reduce the amount of air travel (normally for environmental reasons) while still allowing the average-income citizen access to air travel for the occasional holiday.
#,EmptyHomesTax,빈집세,"A tax levied on homes that are mostly left empty, generally second homes owned by the wealthy and used for a month or two each year.

#,DivertedProfitsTax,우회이익세,"실제 신고금액과 무관하게 대기업들의 국내에서 발생한 것으로 추정되는 이익에 부과하는 세금이다. 이러한 조세제도는 다국적기업들이 각종 회계기법을 악용해 법인세가 낮거나 없는 조세피난처에서 모든 수익이 발생했다 주장하는 식으로 법인세를 회피하는 것을 방지하기 위해 사용된다. 즉, 우회이익세는 조세제도를 악용하는 다국적기업들에게 법을 조문 그대로만 지키는 것이 아니라 법의 정신을 지키도록 하는 유인책으로 고안된 것이다."
#,UniversalBasicIncome,보편적 기본소득,"A universal welfare payment given to everyone in society at a flat rate regardless of their income or wealth.

#,MinimumWage,최저임금,"A completely unregulated labor market can lead to wages that trap people in poverty. The government setting a minimum wage addresses this, and reduces inequality, but minimum wages are a market distortion that could push some companies out of business."
#,GayMarriage,동성결혼,"Traditionally, many religions only support marriage between a man and a woman, but more liberal societies are happy to have legally-significant civil partnerships, or even marriages between same sex couples. It's a matter of debate as to whether these should be carried out in churches and by priests."
#,RightToDie,안락사 권리,"Although clearly punishing people for taking their own life is futile, the state often makes it a crime to assist in someone's early death, even if they are in great pain and are unable to carry out the act without help. Religions often take a dim view of suicide, or those assisting in it, regardless of circumstances."
#,RightToPrivacy,프라이버시권,"As more of our lives are led online, and tracking everyone's actions and movements becomes easier, some people argue that the right to privacy both from government and from corporations is essential, despite the impact this would have on corporate profits or law enforcement."
#,GenderTransition,성전환,"Some religious groups, and conservative sections of society argue that there are only two genders, and that changing gender should not be allowed. Others argue that gender has always been fluid and nobody should enforce their gender views on others. Ultimately the state has to take a stance on the extent to which gender transition is officially accepted or rejected."
#,PrisonRegime,교도소 운영정책,"진보주의자들은 재소자들을 교화시키고, 석방된 이후에 범죄의 길에 다시 빠지지 않도록 일자리를 구할 수 있게 해주어야 한다는 지향점을 가지고 있다. 반면에 보수주의자들은 교도소가 강한 위하력을 보여주어야 하며, 그러기 위해서는 범죄에 대한 처벌의 기능을 강조해야 한다고 본다."
#,Reforestation,녹화사업,"As a measure to combat CO2, Tree-planting is relatively uncontroversial. However, some campaigners suggest this is treating the symptom, not the cause, and that CO2 should be reduced at source, not captured afterwards."
#,StateBroadcaster,공영방송,"A state-owned broadcaster can provide impartial and independent news without influence from corporate advertising. This can serve as a defense against biased or fake news, but a compulsory 'TV-tax' is not popular with everybody."
#,WorkersOnBoards,노동이사제,"Unpopular with capitalists, who fear that workers will basically vote themselves higher pay and shorter hours. Socialists and trade unionists see this policy as ensuring a company works for its employees as well as its shareholders."
#,TearGas,최루가스,"Tear gas is a great way to control angry crowds, but can have health effects and is seen as a tool of authoritarian regimes. Tear gas is generally only used as a last resort."

#,QuantitativeEasing,양적완화,"중앙은행이 화폐를 발행해 채권이나 주식을 직접 매입하는 비전통적인 통화정책의 일종이다. 즉각적인 경제활동 촉진 효과를 볼 수 있지만, 인플레이션을 증가시키고 주식 소유자의 부를 증대시켜 주게 된다."
#,HelicopterMoney,헬리콥터 머니,"경제를 즉각적으로 활성화시키기 위해 고안된 이례적인 정책으로, 정부가 사실상 돈을 찍어내 시민들에게 쓰라고 직접 나누어주는 방식이다. 지급액은 일정액을 정해서 주며, 고소득층에게는 지급되지 않을 수 있다. 화폐발행을 이용하는 정책이 모두 그렇듯 인플레이션을 유발한다."
#,CharityTaxRelief,기부금 세액공제,"A policy designed to encourage the wealthy, or anybody who pays tax, to donate to charity, by deducting some of their charitable donations from their income when calculating various taxes."
,,,
#,ExecutiveTermLength,임기,"다음 선거가 있기 전까지 한 개인이 정부를 이끌 수 있는 기간이다. 임기 기간을 변경하려면 엄청난 규모의 정치적인 노력이 필요할 것이다. 지도자를 선출하는 것은 국민이 민주주의 제도에 직접 영향력을 행사할 수 있는 몇 안되는 상황 중 하나이다. 따라서 선거가 더 자주 치러질수록 나라의 민주주의 수준도 올라가게 된다."
#,ExecutiveTermLimit,연임 제한,"국가의 지도자가 재선될 수 있는 횟수 제한이다. 연임 제한은 한 국가 지도자가 평생 집무실을 차지하는 독점적 통치 행태를 제한하는 수단으로 작용한다. 연임 제한을 두는 것은 민주주의를 유지하기 위한 중요한 견제수단이기도 하지만 유능한 지도력이 가져다주는 성과를 줄일 수도 있기때문에 적당한 균형점을 찾는 것이 중요하다."
#,JudiciaryIndependence,사법 독립성,"권력분립은 국가권력을 각기 다른 책무를 가진 여러 부로 분할시킬 것을 요구하는 통치구조이다. 사법부는 전국의 법원들로 구성되며, 국가의 법률을 해석하고 적용하는 역할을 한다. 다른 부나 사익이 법원의 결정에 영향력을 행사하기 시작하면 사법 독립성은 무너지게 된다."
#,PressFreedom,언론의 자유,"언론의 자유는 곧 전자 및 출판 매체를 활용한 표현과 통신의 자유이다. 언론의 자유는 의견과 사상을 검열받지 않고 자유로이 전달할 수 있는 자유로서 인권의 근간이 되는 표현의 자유와 밀접하게 연관되어 있다. 언론의 자유를 축소한다면 민주주의에 부정적인 영향을 미치겠지만, 동시에 정보 접근에 대한 검열통제를 가능하게 해줄 것이다."
#,ForeignInvestmentRestrictions,외국인 투자제한 제도,"With foreign investment comes foreign influence. Where such influence is seen to be unwelcome, restrictions can be put in place to stem foreign investment. This curtailment of a global free market is generally unpopular with capitalists, but supported by patriots, who are against any foreign influence exerted on their nation."
#,GameHunting,사냥 제한,"Hunting animals for sport is a contentious pursuit, especially if their numbers in the wild are dwindling. However, wild animals can be considered to be part of a country's natural resources, able to be exploited to create a valuable hunting industry. Regulating game hunting is a way of managing animal populations, protecting other species, and ensuring hunters pay for their privileges. Of course, nature may be best served by an outright ban."
#,AntiCorruptionAgency,반부패기구,"Establishes an anti-corruption enforcement agency. Eliminating corruption may be mandated, but detecting perpetrators and prosecuting them is the only way to stamp out the abuse of power for personal gain. The more resources an anti-corruption agency has, the more powerful the offenders that they can bring to justice."
#,FemaleGenitalMutilationBan,할례 금지,"Genital mutilation is a  ritual inflicted on children (both male and female), and perpetuated by an inherited social and religious acceptance of the practice. Make it clear to all citizens that this violence towards children is no longer acceptable with an outright ban. By allocating resources to this ban's enforcement, its impact will be deeper and more rapidly felt."
#,IntellectualPropertyRights,지적재산권,"Establish the protection of innovative ideas by granting their creators a period of monopoly over their use. Advocates of intellectual property rights claim that invention is incentivized by allowing the owners of ideas to benefit financially. The aim is to promote creativity and progress. However, in practice the use of these rights tends to favor the resource rich, who can pay for rights registration and enforcement."
#,GenderDiscriminationAct,성차별금지법,"Make discrimination against women illegal. As well as equal rights for women being written into law, the step can be taken to correct historic inequality with positive action. Affirmative action favors the employment, or appointment, of women for roles across the full spectrum of the labor market and political system. "
#,FamilyPlanning,가족계획,"Implement a program of family planning to improve sexual health in your country. Typical services include education, medical advice, and contraception distribution.

#,TobaccoAwarenessCampaign,금연 캠페인,"Governments have long known the terrible harm that smoking does to its citizens health, but getting them to kick the habit is harder than it sounds. A tradeoff has to be made between reducing the impact on the nations health services versus any tax revenue that smoking brings in."
#,CapitalControls,자본이동 통제,"Restrictions on the flow of capital out of the country. This is a fairly extreme measure to prevent wealth flowing out of a country. Citizens are prevented from taking more than some fixed amount of currency out of the country, in order to prevent capital flight, where the wealthy leave and take their wealth with them. This is very unpopular with the wealthy, and capitalists who see it as a restriction on their freedom of movement and their property rights."
#,BodyCameras,바디캠,"The compulsory wearing of cameras by law enforcement workers is a way to ensure that those workers stick to the law themselves and act in a respectful and honorable way when engaging with members of the public. Without cameras, corruption and bullying complaints against police are not so easily dealt with."
#,SocialCare,사회적 돌봄,"A package of policies which provide care directly to those who need it, from the state. This includes day-care and residential care-home for the elderly who can no longer live alone, care for dementia and support for women's refuges, and for people with mental health difficulties."
#,CongestionCharging,혼잡통행료,"In many large cities, the number of cars travelling in each day is simply unsustainable. Although a fairly blunt instrument, simply charging (through number plate recognition) every vehicle that enters a city each day has proven to be an effective way to reduce congestion in extreme cases."
#,PrisonerVoting,재소자 선거권,"In some countries, all prisoners retain the right to take part in elections, in order to encourage a feeling of still being a part of society and to ensure their welfare is represented. In others, the right to vote is seen as a privilege granted to those who abide by society's rules, and rightfully removed from those who are incarcerated."
#,SelectiveSchooling,비평준화 교육,"정부는 모든 학생들이 능력과 무관하게 같은 교실에서 함께 교육받아야 하는지, 아니면 재능있는 학생들을 따로 모아서 빠르게 수업을 나가거나 아예 최고의 능력을 가진 학생들을 별도의 학교를 두어 선발해야 하는지 결정해야만 한다."
#,Cyberbullyingawarenesscampaign,사이버폭력 인식캠페인,"A program of adverts on TV, radio, online and billboards to warn parents and teachers to look out for signs their children are being bullied online, so that the problem can be spotted early and dealt with before it affects children's mental health."

#,DrugTreatment,마약중독 치료계획,"Punishing people for taking illegal drugs only goes so far. What people really need is treatment, and a long term plan to get people off their dependence on narcotics. These schemes aim to fight the drug issue by reducing demand, instead of limiting supply."
#,StateAirline,항공공사,"So much prestige is wrapped up in a national airline, that literally flies the flag for our country, that its often considered worthwhile to have a state-owned and run airline, maybe run at a loss to encourage tourism, and patriotism."
#,StatePostService,우체국공사,"A state-owned and run postal service can make sense because it is a natural monopoly, and one where a universal service obligation (deliveries to all addresses for the same cost) is generally preferred. The postal service is also a large creator of employment."
#,NuclearFission,원자력 발전소,"핵분열은 CO2 배출과 함께 석유와 가스 수요를 획기적으로 줄일 수 있는 재생가능한 에너지원이 틀림없지만, 전력생산비용이 비쌀 수 있으며 방사성 폐기물과 원자로 폐로에 관련된 문제가 따라오게 된다. 환경주의자들은 원자력 대신 풍력과 태양에너지를 선호하는 경향이 있다."
,,,
#,SolidarityTax,연대세,"A top-up to Income Tax that is particular to Germany and which was introduced to help cover the costs associated with the reunification of East and West Germany, and the the need to upgrade infrastructure throughout east Germany."
#,BanCoal,석탄사용 금지,"In the fight against Climate Change, it is worth remembering that coal is one of the worst possible contributors, and it makes sense that now we have the technology to switch to using renewable energy (or even oil & gas) for our needs, that we pass a law to stop the remaining use of this highly polluting energy source."
#,FinancialTransactionsTax,금융거래세,"투자는 다 좋은게 좋은 일이지만, 실질적으로 들여다보면 금융거래의 대부분은 불필요한 투기이고 사실상의 도박이나 다름이 없으며, 결국 헤지펀드와 금융계에게만 막대한 이익을 가져다줄 뿐 그 어떤 가치도 창출하지 않는다. 각 거래마다 약간의 세금을 붙인다면 조세수입도 늘리도 위험한 투기도 줄일 수 있을 것이다."
#,ProportionalFines,재산비례벌금제,"A fine is no deterrent to anti-social behavior at all if it does not scale with income. What may be a colossal and finances-wrecking penalty for some is a mere inconvenience for the ultra-wealthy. By making all fines scale with income, the law can finally be applied equally to all. Is that fair?"
,,,
#,RetirementAge,정년제도,"공적연금이 존재하는 나라에서 정년은 근로자가 은퇴해 국가로부터 연금을 받을 수 있는 최소연령을 결정한다. 또한 기업들도 자체적으로 정년을 정할 때 정부에서 정한 정년을 기준점으로 흔히 사용하기도 한다. 일찍 은퇴한다면 근로자들은 좋을 수도 있지만, 경제에 영향이 가고 생산성도 떨어질 것이다."
#,CitizenshipForSale,시민권 판매,"Where immigration causes concern about an influx of low paid workers, or those who may be dependent on the state or otherwise represent a  drag on resources, citizenship may be granted to those immigrants who have considerable personal wealth, and thus can prove they will not be a burden. This may appear to be unfair to the majority of would be immigrants without such means."
#,ImmigrationRules,이민법,"이민을 올 수 있는 사람과 없는 사람을 규정하는 법률이다. 공식적으로 규정이 어떻게 되건 불법이민자들에게는 큰 영향이 없을지 몰라도, 이민 전반에는 큰 영향을 미칠 수 있다. 이민자들이 경제를 활성화시킬 것이라 믿는 이들도 있지만, 저임금 노동자들은 일자리를 두고 경쟁이 심해질 것이라 우려하고는 한다."
#,RefugeePolicy,난민정책,"대부분의 국가는 재난 지역이나 전쟁으로 폐허가 된 국가에서 온 이민자들을 받아주어야 할 도덕적 책임이 있다는 점은 인정하지만, 기후변화나 기타 요소로 인해 국제적으로 난민이 크게 늘어나거나 하는 상황에서 난민의 요건과 한도를 어디까지 풀어야 하는지에 관해서는 격렬한 논쟁이 따라온다."
,,,
#,banwomendriving,여성 운전금지,"Whether the justification is some passage in a religious text, or just a general cultural attitude that implies women can not or should not control a motor vehicle, this policy represents restrictions on 50% of the population in terms of their freedom to drive. This may be popular with extreme conservative and religious groups but is the extreme opposite of liberalism and gender equality."
#,religioustax,교회세,"Effectively an income tax, or tithe that hands a percentage of peoples earnings directly to religious institutions, for use as they see fit. Hopefully this funnels money into good causes in the same way as charities do, but there is ample room for corruption as unlike the state, religious leaders are not elected by those paying this tax."
#,religiousbanknotes,종교요소 화폐도안,"This policy allows for the use of religious phrasing, or iconography on banknotes and coins. A powerful way to remind citizens that religion is a big part of their lives, and is effectively part of the state. This can cause offense among those who demand separation of church and state."
#,statereligion,국교,"A country can select a specific religion as the official religion for the state, even if it still permits atheism and the worship of other religions. At the least this involves some ceremony, but it can also extend to giving actual political power to unelected church representatives, and involving the church in procedures such as swearing in new elected representatives."
,,,
#,desalination,담수화 시설,"Desalination plants are a way to make water suitable for human consumption using seawater as an input. Although expensive and energy intensive, it is a solution to a water shortage where other methods to prevent the shortage have failed or are insufficient or unpopular."
#,watermeters,수도계량기 의무설치,"The installation of water meters for every household, and the subsequent charging for water based on consumption is one very effective method for reducing water usage and preventing a water shortage, although it can be a long slow process to install meters for every house in the country."
#,plasticstax,플라스틱세,Plastic waste is a major concern among environmentalists due to the very long time that waste plastic can remain in our ecosystem. A tax on plastic production ensures that environmentally friendly alternatives are chosen instead when suitable.
#,packagingtax,포장세,"Even with recycling, the use of excess packaging can be an environmental disaster. One solution is taxing the production or use of packaging materials. This gives business an incentive to work on more efficient designs for their product packaging."
#,unexplainedwealth,재산출처 공개명령제,"A break with the normal assumption of innocence until proven guilty, unexplained wealth orders allow prosecution where a wealthy individual cannot explain where their wealth comes from. Controversial, but an effective policy against career criminals who are clearly profiting from crime, but have covered their tracks well."
#,competitionlaw,독점규제법,"독점규제법은 기본적으로 자유시장의 이상적 원칙을 지키고 소비자를 독점의 폐해로부터 보호하며 경쟁을 장려하는 것과, 기업이 성장할 수 있게 하고 우수한 기업의 성공을 보장하는 것 두 가지 사이의 균형을 찾아야 하는 법률이다."
#,bordernavy,해안경비대,"Border walls cannot work in an ocean, so the equivalent means of deterring illegal immigration for islands and nations with extensive coastline is to invest in patrol boats that intercept and send back any ships carrying illegal immigrants."
#,NuclearWeapons,핵무기,"핵무기는 국가를 상대로 한 중대한 군사행동에 대한 궁극적인 억제 수단이다. 신뢰성있게 핵공격을 방어할 수단은 존재하지 않지만, 보복타격의 위협 그 자체만으로 타국의 공격을 저지하기에 충분하다. 신뢰성있는 2차 타격능력을 완전히 보장하기 위해선 국가는 가능하다면 전략원잠을 운용하고 적에게 탐지되지 않도록 지속적으로 순찰시키는 방식을 채택하거나, 이론적으로는 우주발사 병기를 운용할 수도 있을 것이다."
#,co2campaign,탄소저감 캠페인,"Government can pass laws, and make spending plans, but it can also tackle the issue of Climate Change by actively urging its citizens to reduce their emissions voluntarily. A public information campaign can persuade citizens not to waste energy and to choose environmentally friendly products, means of transport and even to eat less meat."
